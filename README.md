# Simple To-Do Website

Basic website that allows the user to create and delete tasks to perform, allowing the user to add a Category and due date for the task they enter.
The website will save user information that was entered to local memory, allowing them to return to the website and see tasks they entered previously.




# Information Learned
* How to modify Document Object Model using JS
* Properly using JSON's stringify method to convert JS to JSON
* How to use HTML and CSS to build a (very basic) website!
* Basic error handling in JS. Will need to 






# Future Plans 
- [ ] Allow the user to sort their tasks by category or due date
- [ ] Display the tasks the user has already entered if they refresh the page(ie dont have to add a task to see all previous tasks)
- [ ] Ability for user to search for specific tasks they've entered


# How to Use
* Since this website is not actually on the Internet, you must have VSCode Installed
* Also have to have Live Server Extension, along with HTML CSS Support
* Run the Website using the Live Server functionality
